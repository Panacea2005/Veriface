similarity:
  cosine:
    threshold: 0.55  # Stricter for sibling discrimination (validated EER: 0.2344)
    method: delta_margin  # Best for preventing sibling false positives
    k: 2  # Top-K: Take top 2 out of 5 (not used for delta_margin)
    vote_threshold: 0.6  # Hybrid: 60% of embeddings must pass
    margin_threshold: 0.20  # Delta-Margin: min gap between 1st & 2nd (increased from 0.15)
  euclidean:
    threshold: 1.23

# Anti-spoof uses DeepFace argmax (no threshold)
