# Similarity thresholds
similarity:
  cosine:
    threshold: 0.75
  euclidean:
    # For unit-normalized embeddings, euclidean relates to cosine by d = sqrt(2*(1-cos))
    # Cosine 0.75 => d ≈ 0.707. Keep slightly conservative.
    threshold: 0.72

# Liveness detection threshold
# Optimized for DeepFace-based detection (more accurate than heuristic, similar to ONNX)
# DeepFace provides better accuracy, so threshold can be more balanced
anti_spoof:
  threshold: 0.45  # Optimized for DeepFace - real faces typically score 0.5-0.9, spoofs score 0.1-0.4
