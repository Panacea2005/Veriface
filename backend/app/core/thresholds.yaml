  cosine:
    # Thresholds for different models
    threshold: 0.4  # Default for PyTorch trained model (validated EER: 0.2344)
    threshold_pytorch: 0.4  # PyTorch trained model threshold (stricter for sibling discrimination)
    threshold_deepface: 0.5  # DeepFace ArcFace standard threshold (validated by DeepFace library)
    method: max  # Best for multi-pose: selects best matching angle (fastest, simplest)
    k: 3  # Top-K: Take top 3 out of 5 embeddings (not used for max)
    vote_threshold: 0.6  # Hybrid: 60% of embeddings must pass (not used for max)
    margin_threshold: 0.20  # Delta-Margin: min gap between 1st & 2nd (not used for max)

    threshold: 1.23

# Anti-spoof uses DeepFace argmax (no threshold)
# Note: Threshold is automatically selected based on DEEPFACE_ONLY environment variable
# - DEEPFACE_ONLY=1: Uses threshold_deepface (0.68)
# - DEEPFACE_ONLY=0: Uses threshold_pytorch (0.4)
